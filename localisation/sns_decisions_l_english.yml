 #Formables
 reform_gran_colombia_title: "Restore Bolivar's Colombia"
 reform_gran_colombia_desc: "Simon Bolivar once had a dream of a South America united against imperialism, but that dream echoes of irony today as he could not save even his own nation from falling into pieces. Bolivar may be dead, but his ideals lives in the hearts of anyone who lives in Gran Colombia. We must reunite the pieces of his nation and prove once and for all that Colombia is the bastion against European imperialism!"
